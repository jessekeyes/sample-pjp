A complete redesign of the japanesegarden.org website (and migration to WordPress for easier management) to go along with the Park's physical renovation and reopening. The design and content strategy is large bold imagery, customizable layouts, as well as up-to-date information and park status.

As the frontend web developer and WordPress expert, I worked with a small team managed by The Forest for the Trees, Ltd. to accomplish the above goals. I was responsible for doing all UI development based on our team's custom design (SASS, jQuery, PHP templating, assets). I also managed the WordPress setup and strategy in a pre-Gutenberg era. Pantheon development, some PHP plugin extensions and heavy lifting was done by other team members.
